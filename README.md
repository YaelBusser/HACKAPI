# HACKAPI

This repository contains a project developed as part of a practical assignment for my MDS school program. You can view
the assignment instructions in this [repository](https://github.com/kevinniel/M1-MDS-2425-API), created for an M1-level
API course.

## Conceptual Data Model

Below is Version 1 of the conceptual data model, designed to address all required functionalities and specifications for
the database.

## Project Installation

1. Host the `hackapi` database (found in the `data-save` folder) on your local server (I personally use XAMPP).

2. Declare the following variables in the `.env` file:
    - `DATABASE_URL`
    - `PORT`
    - `JWT_SECRET`
