   - <span style="color: red;">the latest actions performed,</span>
   - <span style="color: red;">recent actions of a specific user,</span>
   - <span style="color: red;">recent actions related to a specific feature.</span>
- <span style="color: green;">Strict adherence to RESTful conventions.</span>

- <span style="color: green;">Test your API in POSTMAN, including:</span>
   - <span style="color: green;">Organizing your routes in collections and within a project</span>
   - <span style="color: green;">Automating the generation of the bearer token and its transmission in all requests (Bearer = JWT).</span>


## Conceptual Data Model

Below is Version 1 of the conceptual data model, which incorporates all required functionalities and specifications for the database.

## Project Installation

1. Host the `hackapi` database (found in the `data-save` folder) on your local server (I personally use XAMPP).

2. Create and define the following variables in the `.env` file:
   - `DATABASE_URL=mysql://root:@localhost:3306/hackapi?schema=public`
   - `PORT=4000`
   - `JWT_SECRET=hackapiJWT`

## Usage Instructions

To interact with the API functionalities, you can use Postman, for instance, to set up the Bearer token.
